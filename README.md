# MobileHelloWorld<br><br>
This was our introduction to Android development!<br>
In this, we were responsibile for creating a login screen that took users to a homepage in the application. From the homepage, users could choose to "logout", which would bring them back to the login page from the start<br><br>
I'll be providing all relevant screenshots below:<br>
First, the login screen:<br>

Followed by the welcome screen:<br>

Next, we have the relevant code. We will start with the java files. First up, MainActivity.java (login screen):<br>

Next, the "home" screen, or welcome screen:<br>

Lastly, I'll share some screenshots of relevant xml files (layouts):<br>
main activity:<br>

And then, for the home activity:<br>

Lastly, here are two files I created to add rounded corners to my text/edit boxes, as I personally thought that looked cleaner:<br>

These basically differ in that one has a white background, while there other is "transluscent", i.e. its background color is the same as the parent page (the green color). Both do have borders, as you can see.<br><br>
And of course, as usual, the link to a youtube video describing this all:
